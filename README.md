👋 Hello! You've landed here because we're considering your profile for our Big Data Engineer role.

# The context

What’s a better way to start than letting your skills do the talking? Time for some data processing. 😉 

For the purpose of the interview, we are also interested in the explanations, the reasoning and decision-making together with the actual output.

From a tech stack perspective, you can use any programming language or toolset you're comfortable with. We learn to master new tools every day and we think the reasoning behind decisions is the one that counts the most. You can probably get up to speed with the rest rather quickly.

We're sure you'll kick ass! 💪

# The assignment

The input for this assignment is an archive ( download **[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jF7lnMUffCX8U252MoY7jowb7VedFOp8/view?usp=sharing)** ) containing 3 datasets with data about the same companies from 3 different sources: 

1. Facebook (facebook dataset.csv)
2. Google (google dataset.csv)
3. Company Website (website dataset.csv)

The final purpose of this exercise is to create a 4th dataset that contains the other 3 and, by joining them, we should reach a better accuracy on common columns. The columns that interest us the most are Category, Address(country, region...), Phone, Company names.

The decisions you'll have to make in order to join the 3 datasets include:

1. What column will you use to join?
2. If you have data conflicts once you join, which one do you believe?
3. If you have very similar data, what information will you keep?

Good luck! 🍀
